# League of Legends Atakhan Relevance Analysis
Conducted by: Andrew Youn

##Introduction
###League of Legends
League of Legends (LoL) is one of the most popular Massive Multipler Online (MMO) games in history. Released on October 27. 2009 by Riot Games, LoL quickly took the world by storm and amassed nearly 30-40 million active players daily as of 2025. Beyond casual play, the game has also established a massive professional esports scene, with regional leagues and international tournaments watched by millions.

In League of Legends, two teams of five players compete on a map with the primary objective of destroying the opposing team’s Nexus, a central structure located within their base. To reach the Nexus, teams must strategically work together to destroy defensive structures, secure neutral objectives, and gain advantages in gold, experience, and map control. Matches require a combination of mechanical skill, teamwork, and strategic decision-making, making LoL a rich environment for data-driven analysis.

This project focuses on analyzing professional League of Legends match data, provided by Orcale's Elixir, to better understand how in-game objectives—specifically Atakhan—relate to team success and win outcomes. Despite its popularity, Atakhan is scheduled to be removed in an upcoming League of Legends patch as part of Riot Games’ ongoing efforts to keep the game fresh and prevent gameplay from becoming stale. Major game updates and seasonal changes are a core part of League of Legends’ design philosophy, even if it means retiring impactful in-game objectives.

Given Atakhan’s impending removal, this project seeks to better understand its role in professional play while it is still present in the game. Specifically, this analysis aims to answer the following research question:

How likely are professional League of Legends teams to win a match if they secure Atakhan?

By examining match-level data from professional games, this study explores whether securing Atakhan is meaningfully associated with higher win rates and how predictive this objective is of match outcomes.
